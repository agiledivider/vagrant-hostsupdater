# Vagrant::Hostsupdater

This plugin adds an entry to your /etc/hosts file on the host system.

On **up**, **resume** and **reload** commands, it tries to add the information, if its not already existant in your hosts file. If it needs to be added, you will be asked for an administrator password, since it uses sudo to edit the file.

On **halt** and **destroy**, those entries will be removed again.
By setting the remove\_on\_suspend option, you can have them removed on **suspend**, too:

    config.hostsupdater.remove_on_suspend = true



## Installation

    $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater

Uninstall it with:

    $ vagrant plugin uninstall vagrant-hostsupdater

## Usage

At the moment, the only things you need, are the hostname and a :private_network network with a fixed ip.

    config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.3.10"
    config.vm.hostname = "www.testing.de"
    config.hostsupdater.aliases = ["alias.testing.de", "alias2.somedomain.com"]

This ip and the hostname will be used for the entry in the /etc/hosts file.

## For AWS

If you'd like AWS as a provider using [vagrant-aws](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws) or other plugin,
this plugin will detect the instance public IP by the tag infomations.  
For example, [vagrant-aws](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws) configures a tag infomations like the following.

    config.vm.provider :aws do |aws, override|
      aws.tags = {
        "Name" => "vagrant",
        ...
      }
      aws.elastic_ip = true
      ...
    end

* [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) is required
* Make the tag infomations be unique for the instance
* Enable Elastic IP for the instance
